Question,Answer
What class of receptors do beta-blockers block?,Beta-adrenergic receptors
What is the drug class of metoprolol?,Selective beta-1 blocker
What is the drug class of propranolol?,Non-selective beta blocker
What receptors does metoprolol selectively block?,Beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart
What is the mechanism of metoprolol?,"Selectively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, reducing heart rate and contractility"
What receptors does propranolol block?,Both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors
Where does propranolol act?,Throughout the body
What is the selectivity difference between metoprolol and propranolol?,Metoprolol: selective beta-1 (cardioselective); Propranolol: non-selective (beta-1 AND beta-2)
What are the clinical uses of metoprolol?,"Hypertension, Angina pectoris, Myocardial infarction, Heart failure (stable)"
What are the clinical uses of propranolol?,"Hypertension, Angina pectoris, Migraine prophylaxis, Essential tremor, Performance anxiety"
Which beta-blocker is used for hypertension?,Both metoprolol and propranolol

What are the adverse effects of propranolol?,"Bradycardia, Bronchospasm, Hypotension, Fatigue, Masking of hypoglycemia symptoms"
Which adverse effect is unique to propranolol?,Bronchospasm (due to beta-2 blockade)
Why does propranolol cause bronchospasm?,Due to beta-2 blockade
What contraindications apply to both metoprolol and propranolol?,"Sick sinus syndrome, Second or third-degree AV block, Severe bradycardia"
What is an additional contraindication specific to propranolol?,Asthma or COPD
Why is propranolol contraindicated in asthma/COPD?,Causes bronchospasm due to beta-2 blockade
What must be done when discontinuing beta-blockers?,Must be tapered
Why must beta-blockers be tapered?,To avoid rebound hypertension
What effect do beta-blockers have on heart rate?,Reduce heart rate
What effect do beta-blockers have on contractility?,Reduce contractility
What effect do beta-blockers have on blood pressure?,Lower blood pressure
