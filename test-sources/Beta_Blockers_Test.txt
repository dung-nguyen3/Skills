Learning Objectives:

1. Describe the mechanism of action of beta-blockers
2. List the clinical uses of metoprolol and propranolol
3. Identify the major adverse effects of beta-blockers

BETA-BLOCKERS

Beta-blockers are a class of medications that block beta-adrenergic receptors.

METOPROLOL (Lopressor)

Drug Class: Selective beta-1 blocker

Mechanism: Selectively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, reducing heart rate and contractility.

Clinical Uses:
- Hypertension
- Angina pectoris
- Myocardial infarction
- Heart failure (stable)

Adverse Effects:
- Bradycardia
- Hypotension
- Fatigue
- Cold extremities

Contraindications:
- Sick sinus syndrome
- Second or third-degree AV block
- Severe bradycardia

PROPRANOLOL (Inderal)

Drug Class: Non-selective beta blocker

Mechanism: Blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors throughout the body.

Clinical Uses:
- Hypertension
- Angina pectoris
- Migraine prophylaxis
- Essential tremor
- Performance anxiety

Adverse Effects:
- Bradycardia
- Bronchospasm (due to beta-2 blockade)
- Hypotension
- Fatigue
- Masking of hypoglycemia symptoms

Contraindications:
- Asthma or COPD
- Sick sinus syndrome
- Second or third-degree AV block
- Severe bradycardia

KEY COMPARISONS:

Selectivity:
- Metoprolol: Selective beta-1 blocker (cardioselective)
- Propranolol: Non-selective (blocks beta-1 AND beta-2)

Clinical Implication:
- Metoprolol safer in patients with respiratory disease
- Propranolol crosses blood-brain barrier → useful for anxiety, tremor, migraine

Both drugs:
- Reduce heart rate and contractility
- Lower blood pressure
- Must be tapered when discontinuing (avoid rebound hypertension)
