Create drug autobiography stories from source file: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

### Step 1: Pre-Creation Verification

**MANDATORY - State this checklist FIRST:**

```
VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
☐ Source file: $ARGUMENTS
☐ Template: Autobiography_Drug_Stories_REVISED.txt
☐ Source-only policy: I will ONLY use information from source file
☐ Exception: Creative analogies/metaphors WILL be researched via WebSearch
☐ MANDATORY: I will WebSearch for storytelling devices and memory techniques
☐ Save location: [Class]/[Exam]/Claude Study Tools/
```

### Step 2: Load Resources

Read these files in order:
1. **Template**: `study-guides/templates-and-examples/Autobiography_Drug_Stories_REVISED.txt`
   - Storytelling guidelines and character development
   - Narrative structure requirements
   - Creative metaphor examples

2. **Source File**: $ARGUMENTS
   - Extract all drug information
   - Note mechanisms, uses, side effects
   - Identify drug classes and relationships

### Step 3: Create Drug Biography Stories

Follow template instructions EXACTLY:

**Required Structure:**

**For Each Drug:**
1. **Introduction** - Drug introduces themselves (generic + brand name, main role)
2. **Mechanism of Action** - As a creative story with analogies
3. **Therapeutic Uses** - Described as "missions" or "adventures"
4. **Side Effects** - As "challenges," "secrets," or "weaknesses"
5. **Interactions** - As relationships with other characters
6. **Clinical Pearls** - As "wisdom" or "advice"

**Character Development Requirements:**
- Personify drugs with personality traits matching properties
- Use titles (Mr., Ms., Dr., Professor, Captain, etc.)
- Create family relationships for same-class drugs
- Match personalities to characteristics:
  - Selective drugs = "focused" or "precise"
  - Non-selective = "broad" or "indiscriminate"
  - Toxic = "dangerous" or "dark secrets"
  - Newer = "young" or "modern"
  - Older = "veterans" or "old-timers"

**WebSearch Requirements (MANDATORY):**
- Research creative analogies and metaphors for mechanisms
- Find character traits and storytelling devices
- Look for established medical education analogies
- Search for proven memory techniques

**Key Rules:**
- Use ONLY source file information (except creative analogies)
- Keep stories medically accurate
- Make mechanisms memorable through narrative
- Connect related drugs through character relationships
- Output format: Word document (.docx)

### Step 4: Use TodoWrite

Track your progress:
- Create todo for each drug biography
- Mark in_progress as you work
- Mark completed when done
- Keep user informed

### Step 5: Post-Creation Verification

**Automatically verify the completed document:**

1. **Source Accuracy**
   - All medical info from source only
   - Creative elements (analogies) marked if external
   - No invented medical facts

2. **Story Completeness**
   - Each drug has: intro, mechanism story, uses, side effects, interactions, pearls
   - All drugs from source file included
   - Family relationships established for drug classes

3. **Character Development**
   - Each drug personified with appropriate personality
   - Titles and relationships consistent
   - Personalities match pharmacological properties

4. **Narrative Quality**
   - Mechanisms explained through creative analogies
   - Stories are engaging and memorable
   - Medical accuracy maintained

5. **WebSearch Verification**
   - Confirm mnemonics/analogies were researched
   - No invented memory devices

**CRITICAL: State "Post-creation verification complete" when done.**

### Step 6: Summary

Provide:
- Number of drug biographies created
- Drug classes covered
- Character relationships established
- File location and name
- Any notes on creative analogies used

## Output Format

**File naming:**
```
[Topic]_Drug_Biographies.docx
```

**Example:**
```
Cardiovascular_Drug_Biographies.docx
HIV_Antiretroviral_Drug_Biographies.docx
Antibiotic_Drug_Biographies.docx
```

## Example Usage

```
/biography "Pharmacology/Exam 3/Extract/Beta-Blockers.txt"
/biography "Cardiology/Drug-List.txt"
/biography sources/HIV-Drugs.txt
```

## Best For

- **Pharmacology courses** - Make drug mechanisms memorable
- **Drug classes** - Show family relationships through characters
- **Complex mechanisms** - Explain through creative stories
- **Exam preparation** - Engaging review material
- **Visual/creative learners** - Story-based memory

## Important Notes

- **Medical accuracy first**: Stories must be medically accurate, not just entertaining
- **Use established analogies**: Research proven teaching analogies via WebSearch
- **Source-only policy**: All medical facts from source file only
- **Character consistency**: Keep personalities/relationships consistent throughout
- **Format**: Word document with sections for each drug

## Template Customization

To modify the drug biography template:
1. Edit: `study-guides/templates-and-examples/Autobiography_Drug_Stories_REVISED.txt`
2. Changes apply automatically to next `/biography` use
3. Update this command file if workflow changes
