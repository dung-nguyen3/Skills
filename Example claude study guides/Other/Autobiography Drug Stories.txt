# **PROMPT: Drug Autobiography Story Generator**

## **Claude's TASK:**

You are an expert at transforming the content in the attached document into an engaging "Drug Autobiography" stories. Each drug should be personified as a character who tells their own story, explaining their mechanisms, uses, and side effects through creative narratives, metaphors, and character interactions.

## **STORYTELLING GUIDELINES:**

### **1. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT**
- **Personify each drug** as a character with personality traits that reflect their pharmacological properties
- Use titles that reflect their role (Mr., Ms., Dr., Professor, Captain, Sir, Lady, General, etc.)
- Create **family relationships** for drugs in the same class (siblings, cousins, brothers, etc.)
- Give drugs **personalities** that match their characteristics:
  - Selective drugs are "focused" or "precise"
  - Non-selective drugs are "broad" or "indiscriminate"
  - Toxic drugs might be "dangerous" or have "dark secrets"
  - Newer drugs can be "young" or "modern"
  - Older drugs can be "veterans" or "old-timers"

### **2. NARRATIVE STRUCTURE**

Each drug story should include:

**A. INTRODUCTION**
- Drug introduces themselves by name (generic and brand name)
- Brief statement of their main role/mission

**B. MECHANISM OF ACTION (as a story)**
- Use creative analogies and metaphors
- Examples:
  - Blocking = "stealing keys," "putting up barriers," "cork in a bottle"
  - Inhibiting = "sabotaging the factory," "removing the ignition"
  - Activating = "turning on switches," "starting engines"
  - Binding = "lock and key," "fitting into slots"
- Explain complex mechanisms through relatable scenarios

**C. CHARACTER INTERACTIONS**
- Drugs can have:
  - **Partners** (drugs used in combination)
  - **Bodyguards/Protectors** (drugs that reduce toxicity)
  - **Enemies** (drug interactions)
  - **Rivals** (competing drugs)
  - **Family members** (same drug class)

**D. UNIQUE TRAITS (Side Effects & Special Properties)**
- Frame side effects as:
  - "Secrets" (toxic effects)
  - "Weaknesses" (limitations)
  - "Dark sides" (serious adverse effects)
  - "Quirks" (unique characteristics)
  - "Superpowers" (unique advantages)

**E. CLINICAL PEARLS**
- Include as dialogue or dramatic revelations
- Use phrases like:
  - "But here's my secret..."
  - "Let me tell you about my arch-enemy..."
  - "My greatest strength is..."
  - "Doctors must NEVER..."
  - "Always pair me with..."

### **3. DIALOGUE & CONVERSATIONS**

Create conversations between drugs that explain:
- Differences between similar drugs
- Why one drug is preferred over another
- Drug-drug interactions
- Combination therapy rationale

**Example format:**
```
Mr. Atenolol asked, "But brother, why do doctors prefer you for anxiety?"

Mr. Propranolol explained, "Because I can cross the blood-brain barrier to calm the central nervous system. You're water-soluble, so you can't get into the brain as easily. But that makes YOU better for patients with asthma!"
```

### **4. CREATIVE ANALOGIES TO USE**

**For Mechanisms:**
- Enzymes = factories, assembly lines, workers
- Receptors = locks, doors, switches, docking stations
- Cell cycle = traffic lights, checkpoints, stages of a journey
- Blood-brain barrier = security checkpoint, fortress wall
- Metabolism = transformation, costume changes
- Protein binding = passengers on a bus, seats taken

**For Drug Actions:**
- Agonists = keys that turn locks
- Antagonists = keys that block locks
- Competitive inhibition = fighting for seats
- Non-competitive = sabotaging the machine itself
- Irreversible binding = super glue
- Prodrugs = Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, transformations

**For Pharmacokinetics:**
- Absorption = entry into the kingdom
- Distribution = traveling through the body
- Metabolism = changing disguises
- Excretion = leaving through the exit doors

### **5. SPECIAL STORY ELEMENTS**

Include these dramatic elements where appropriate:

**🎭 DRAMATIC REVEALS:**
- "But I must confess my THREE toxic secrets..."
- "Here's where my dark side appears..."
- "My Achilles' heel is..."

**⚡ WARNINGS:**
- "NEVER combine me with..."
- "Doctors must ALWAYS..."
- "CRITICAL: Test for... before using me!"

**🦸 RESCUE SCENARIOS:**
- Describe how antidotes/protective agents "save the day"
- Frame them as bodyguards, protectors, or rescue squads

**👥 FAMILY DYNAMICS:**
- Older vs. newer generation drugs
- Competition between family members
- "Golden child" vs. others
- Generational improvements

**Be entertaining and engaging**
