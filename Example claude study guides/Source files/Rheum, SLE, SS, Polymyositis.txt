Objectives
 Describe the clinical manifestations, diagnostic and 
laboratory features, treatment, and patient education for 
the following conditions
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and drug induced lupus
Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis
Sjögren Syndrome
Systemic Sclerosis
Mixed Connective Tissue Disease
Polyarteritis Nodosa

A. Yes
B. No
C. I’m going to pass on 
this question…

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)4

Page 5:
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
 Chronic multi-organ autoimmune disorder
 Skin, joint, kidneys, lungs, nervous system, cardiovascular
 Unpredictable flares and remissions
 Young (esp. reproductive years) adult females
  (7:1) female > males 
 African American > Caucasian (4:1)
 Clinical manifestations are mediated by antibody formation 
and creation of immune complexes (Ab/antigen complexes)
 These deposit in and damage tissue

These changes 
promote production 
of Antinuclear 
Antibodies (ANA)

Clinical Presentation: SLE Can Affect 
Virtually Every Organ
Broad range of symptoms and severity
 General: fatigue (most common feature), fever, LAD, weight loss
 Skin: 
 Photosensitivity
 Malar (“Butterfly rash”): fixed erythema over nasal bridge 
 Discoid: erythematous, scaly patches in sun exposed areas 
 Mucocutaneous: painless oral or nasal mucosa ulcers
 Alopecia
 Raynaud Phenomenon (30% of SLE pts)
◼Vasospasm of digital arteries with exposure to cold temps 
or stress

SLE Diagnostic Lab Testing: Antinuclear 
Antibody
15
 Antinuclear antibody (ANA)     
 [> 95%]
Cardinal feature, but not specific
◼ANA most helpful if high pretest probability
 ANA reported in 2 parts
 Titer of antibodies with serial dilution
◼Controversy regarding ideal dilution to indicate positive
◼ Ex. 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, etc.
◼ Threshold considered positive may vary by lab
Staining pattern of antibodies
◼ Loosely associated with underlying autoimmune disease. Not 
specific. Requires additional testing to dx.

SLE Prognosis
 Varies based on disease severity and type of organ 
involvement
 Survival rate dramatically improved in the last 50 years
 Improved disease recognition, improved therapies, prompt 
recognition and treatment of complications
 Pts with SLE still have mortality rates 2-5x general population
 Poor prognostic indicators
 Renal disease, HTN, male, antiphospholipid Ab syndrome, 
high overall disease activity, low socioeconomic status
 Leading causes of death in pts with SLE
 Active disease (Renal and CNS), Infections , CV disease

Page 24:
SLE:  Referring & Admitting
When to Refer  
 Appropriate diagnosis & 
management requires active 
participation of a 
rheumatologist
 Severity of organ involvement 
dictates referral to other 
subspecialists
When to Admit
 Severe organ-threatening 
manifestations
 Severe infections, especially in 
the setting of 
immunosuppressant therapy

Page 25:
Drug-Induced Lupus
 Clinical and immunologic syndrome with features similar to SLE
 Constitutional, joint, & pleuropericardial sx, + ANA
 Not well understood 
 Certain drugs trigger this autoimmune response

agents, and others.
 Symptoms often develop many months after med exposure
 Patients have a positive antihistone antibody
 Negative anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm Ab
 Hypocomplementemia uncommon
 Treatment: stop the offending drug!
