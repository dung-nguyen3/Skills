What is Gout?
• Crystal-induced inflammatory arthritis
• Cardinal Feature: hyperuricemia
• *Urate deposition occurs when serum uric acid is supersaturated
7
Uric Acid 
precipitates into 
monosodium 
urate (MSU) 
crystals
Deposits in and 
around joints, 
bones, & soft 
tissues
Pain and 
inflammation

• Breakdown product of 
purine metabolism
• Excreted by the kidney
Uric Acid
• Defined as serum uric 
acid level > 6.8 mg/dL 
(exceeding approximate 
limit of urate solubility )
Hyperuricemia

Chronic gouty arthritis and tophaceous gout
Bone changes (erosions) and tophi can develop over time, leading to a symptomatic arthritis 
Intercritical gout (between flares)
Asymptomatic interval between gout attacks
Acute gouty arthritis
First acute flare (“attack”) 
Asymptomatic hyperuricemia
~15% develop gout

Hyperuricemia
Deposition of MSU 
crystals in/around joint
Inflammatory cascade 
(painful joint) Without treatment, 
deposition of crystals 
continue, forming tophi
Chronic gouty arthritis → joint 
destruction (eroding bone and cartilage)

• White chalky material consisting of dense concentrations of MSU crystals
• Function of the duration and severity of hyperuricemia
• May occur at any site: joints, bone, cartilage, and skin

Page 15:
What Can Cause (or Provoke) an Acute Gout Flare ?
Conditions that provoke a change in urate balance or represent an increased 
proinflammatory state: 
• Dietary triggers: 
• Foods high in purines
• EtOH 
• Medications:
• Diuretics (thiazide or loop)
• Urate-lowering medications
• Low-dose aspirin, niacin, cyclosporin
• Trauma, surgery, starvation, dehydration

Page 16:
Clinical Manifestations of Gout
Acute inflammatory arthritis
• “acute gout flare”
Chronic gouty arthritis 
• Palpable tophi, joint limitation, persistent 
inflammation, and joint deformity
Renal complications
• Uric acid nephrolithiasis
• Urate nephropathy 16

Page 17:
Acute Gout Flare  (“attack”)

Page 18:
Acute Gout Flare: 
Clinical Features
• Monoarticular (85-90%) and intensely inflammatory
• Can be polyarticular (<20%)
• 1st MTP joint (“Podagra”): most common location for 
initial attacks 
• Others: Knee, ankle, heel, wrist, fingers, elbow
• Often recurrent, can be self-limiting 
• Without therapy, the gout flare usually resolves 
completely within 1-2 weeks

Page 19:
Typical Acute Flare: History
Rapid onset (often at night)
Severe pain!
Maximal severity of the attack is usually reached within 12-24 hrs.
Lower-extremity involvement
Redness, warmth, swelling, disability
May have fever, chills, malaise

Page 20:
Typical Acute Flare: Physical Exam 
• Signs of inflammation
• Swelling, warmth, erythema, tenderness
• Decreased ROM
• +/- Tophi

Laboratory 
Findings
•Serology 
• ESR/CRP: commonly elevated
• CBC: may see leukocytosis
•Arthrocentesis/synovial fluid analysis 
• Provides a definitive diagnosis
•Testing synovial fluid for: 
• Cell counts/differential white count; 
• Gram stain & culture; and
• Examination for crystals under polarizing light microscopy

Light 
Microscopy
•Evaluating for the presence of crystals, 
and if present, determining what type
•Gout: 
•Monosodium urate crystals
•Needle shaped
•Negatively birefringent

Page 25:
Laboratory Findings: Uric Acid
• Serum Urate
• During a gout flare, serum urate may be high, normal, or low during acute 
flare (not the best test for diagnosis)
• Most accurate, ≥ 2 weeks after acute gout flare subsides
• Helpful to monitor effects of long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT)
• 24hr Urinary Uric Acid
• If uricosuric therapy is being considered 
• Urinary uric acid < 800mg = underexcretor
• Candidate for uricosuric therapy

Diagnosis of Gout
• Preferred approach is based on:
• Identification of MSU crystals on polarizing light microscopy 
• When this is not feasible: 
• Diagnosis may be made based on clinical features including 
history, exam, labs, and imaging studies

Page 29:
Treatment of Gout
Acute and Long-term Management

Page 30:
Management Principles:
• Acute flare treatment 
• Provide rapid and safe pain relief
• Long-term Rx: prevent further attacks and damage to joints/tissues
• Urate-lowering drug therapy
• Risk Reduction: patient education and lifestyle recommendations
• Dietary changes, weight loss, reduction in alcohol intake
• Substitutions for medications that cause hyperuricemia
• Address associated medical conditions

Page 31:
Treatment for an Acute Flare
• Treating pain and inflammation , not lowering serum uric acid
• Options (outpatient management) : NSAIDs, Glucocorticoids, or 
Colchicine
• Tailor therapy to the severity of the flare and to the patient 
Note: if already on urate-lowering therapy (ULT), continue, without interruption

Page 32:
Treatment 
for Acute 
Gout
Acute Gout Tx Dosing Notes
NSAIDs Naproxen 500 mg bid or 
Indomethacin 50 mg q 8 hrs
• Generally, prescription of choice when not 
contraindicated
• Continue until 2-3 days after symptoms have 
completely resolved
Glucocorticoids Oral, intraarticular, IV, IM
Oral: 20-40mg once daily or two 
dived doses
• May taper over 7-10 days after the flare has 
resolved
Colchicine Example regimen:
Initial dose of 1.2mg PO x1, then 
0.6mg PO 1 hr later x 1 (1.8mg total 
dose)
• Often used when intolerant/ CI to 
NSAIDs/glucocorticoids
• May need reduced dose (eg. 0.6mg once or twice 
daily as tolerated) for the duration of the gout flare
• Discontinue within 2-3 days of complete resolution 
of gout flare
Contraindications/concerns for toxicity (see slide in Resources)

Page 33:
Long-term Rx: 
Urate-Lowering Therapy (ULT)
American College of Rheumatology Guidelines

Page 34:
Urate-Lowering Therapy (ULT)
• Pharmacologic therapy to lower serum uric acid levels
• Enhancing renal excretion of uric acid or by decreasing urate synthesis, a 
combination of both, or by uricolytic medications (uricases)
• Long-term maintenance of subsaturating urate levels results in:
• Cessation of gout flares, resolution of tophi
• May need to continue for life to prevent new crystal formation and 
dissolve those already formed

Page 35:
Starting Urate-Lowering Therapy (ULT)
• When to start?
• Shared decision making/individualized based on patient factors
• No contraindication to starting long-term ULT during the treatment of a gout flare
• Remember: initiation of ULT may precipitate an acute flare
• Recommend concurrent prophylaxis with NSAIDs or colchicine to reduce 
the risk of gout flares during the initiation of ULT
• Generally continued for 3-6 months after starting ULT

Page 36:
36
ULT 
Medications
MOA/Indication Notes
Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors (XOIs)
• Allopurinol
Preferred for 
most patients
• Decreases urate synthesis
• Indicated for overproducers and 
underexcretors
• Renal dosing (CrCl <30)
• SE Profile: Rash, hypersensitivity, severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs)+
• Febuxostat • Alternative for patients with reduced kidney 
function
• Conflicting data regarding risk for patients at 
high cardiovascular risk
Uricosuric Agents
• Probenecid • Enhances renal excretion of uric acid
• Indicated for underexcretors
• Requires good renal function
• SE Profile: GI, rash
• Avoid in pts with hx of nephrolithiasis and uric 
acid nephropathy
+Avoid in individuals who are (HLA)-B*58:01 positive 
(Southeast Asian and African American descent)

Page 37:
Treat-to-Target:
Achieving Target Serum Urate Levels
• Maintain serum urate of 6.0 mg/dL or less
• 5.0 mg/dL for tophaceous gout
• Measure at 2-4 weeks on a given dose/adjust prn
• Consider referral to Rheumatologist: 
• Unclear etiology of hyperuricemia
• Difficulty reaching target serum urate level
• Multiple and/or serious adverse effects from ULT

“Gout is 
Like 
Matches”
CURRENT: Rheumatology, 3e. Chapter 44. Gout. Data from Wortmann RL. Effective management of gout: an analogy. Am J Med. 1998;105:513.
Gout is caused by uric acid. Everyone has uric acid in their blood, but some 
people have too much of it, and some of those people get gout. In those 
who get gout, the uric acid accumulates around the joints and acts like 
matches. 
When you get a gout attack, one of the matches strikes and catches the 
joint on fire. When that happens, you should take your indomethacin (or 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug of choice). It is important to take it 
right away. If not, more matches will catch fire and the attack will worsen. 
Taking indomethacin does not cure the gout because it only puts out the 
fire. The matches are still there and can light again. 
A urate-lowering drug will remove the matches. If there are no matches, 
you cannot get gout. But until the urate-lowering drug has time to work, 
you can still get gout. Therefore, you should take colchicine, one pill twice 
a day. Colchicine is very good at preventing gout attacks. You can think of 
colchicine as something that makes the matches damp and harder to 
strike.
