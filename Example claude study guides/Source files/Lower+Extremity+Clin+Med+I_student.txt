◦ X-ray: different presentations
◦ “cloud-like” mass with irregular margins
◦ “onion-skin” periosteal reaction
◦ “sunburst” pattern of new bone
◦MRI: evaluate entire length of bone and 
assess soft tissue involvement
◦ Biopsy required for confirmation
◦Metastasis evaluation: 
◦ Chest CT, PET-CT, and/or bone scan
◦Management: 
◦Orthopedic and oncology referral 
◦ Surgery + adjuvant chemotherapy

Ewing Sarcoma
65
◦Second most common primary bone 
tumor in pediatrics
◦ Peak incidence between ages 10-15 years
◦Arises predominately in long bones 
and flat bones
◦History and Physical Exam: 
◦ Progressive, localized pain ± swelling of weeks to months
◦ May be associated with minor trauma
◦ Bone pain worse at night or with exercise
◦ ± Soft tissue mass
◦ ± Constitutional symptoms
◦ Fever, fatigue, weight loss, and/or anemia
(AAOS, UpToDate)

Ewing Sarcoma
66(AAOS, AAP, UpToDate)
◦Diagnosis
◦ X-ray: indistinct, destructive lesion (“moth-eaten”) 
± soft tissue mass
◦ CT scan or MRI: further evaluate tumor size and 
soft tissue involvement
◦ Biopsy for definitive diagnosis
◦ Cytology: “small round blue cell tumor”
◦ Metastatic work-up
◦ Chest CT, PET scan, and/or bone scan
◦ Treatment
◦ Orthopedic and oncology referral 
◦ Chemotherapy
◦ Surgery
◦ Radiation

◦ Thyroid 
◦ Lung
◦ Radiographs:
◦ Osteoblastic formation (P)
◦ Mixed (B)
◦ Osteolytic bone destruction (KTL)
◦ Skeletal survey with bone scan or PET
