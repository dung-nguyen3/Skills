Spinal Pain: Prevalence & Risk Factors
Up to 85% of adults will have neck or low back pain at some point in their life
Risk Factors:
• Poor physical conditioning
• Poor posture &/or body mechanics
• Occupational hazards - heavy lifting, vibration exposure
• Older age
• Obesity
• Smoking
• Pregnancy

I. Muscles & Ligaments

Page 6:
Strain/Sprain
• Strain → muscle fibers are abnormally 
stretched or torn
• Intense muscular contraction during forceful 
muscle stretch
• Sprain → ligaments torn from their 
attachments
• Sudden torsion, direct blow, forceful 
straightening from crouched position
• Strain/sprain can result from a sudden injury 
or gradual overuse
• Can occur in cervical, thoracic or lumbar 
spine

Page 7:
Strain/Sprain: Presentation & Management
Symptoms & Signs: 
• Postural abnormalities
• Paraspinal and surrounding muscle tenderness, (+/-) muscle guarding
• Cervical spine → occipital cervicogenic headache
• Pain and/or stiffness with movement, often have decreased ROM
• Neurologic exam normal
Management:
• Most have spontaneous resolution w/in 4-6 wks.
• NSAIDs for pain
• Activity modification, ice/heat
• Physical therapy to improve function and reduce pain

Vertebral Compression 
Fracture

Image: https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/globalassets/figures/a00538f03.jpg
• Often occur secondary to osteoporosis
• Decreased bone mass & strength, 
increased fragility
• Characterized by loss of anterior 
vertebral body height of varying degrees
• Often minimal to no trauma
• Most commonly occur thoracolumbar 
junction
• Increased risk for subsequent fracture
• 19% will have another w/in next yr.

Page 10:
Vertebral Compression Fracture: Presentation
• Present w/ acute back pain after minor incident (ie. sudden bending, coughing, 
lifting)
• Can be asymptomatic and later seen incidentally on radiographs
• Localized midline pain
• Dull or sharp in nature
• Often referring out to flank, abdomen, or PSIS unilaterally or bilaterally
• Sxs aggravated w/ movement, sitting, spine extension, Valsalva
Physical exam:
•  Decreased ROM due to pain
• Pain w/ palpation or percussion over spinous process and surrounding musculature
• May have muscle spasm
• Normal neurologic exam

Page 11:
Vertebral Compression Fracture: 
Diagnostics
• Spine radiographs (*1st line)
• Image area of concern
• Anterior-posterior (AP) & lateral view
• MRI if neurologic symptoms or deficits
• CT for moderate to severe vertebral body collapse and/or posterior 
displacement

Page 12:
Vertebral Compression Fracture: Radiographs
12Images: https://radiopaedia.org/cases/20123

Page 13:
Acute Compression Fracture: Management
• Pain control
• Acetaminophen, NSAIDs
• Intranasal calcitonin
• Mild opioids with caution and short-term (only if pain significantly limiting & minimal 
response to above)
• Activity modification
• No bed rest; Limit bending and lifting
• Physical therapy → gait, core strengthening
• Lifestyle modification → smoking cessation, exercise, diet (inc. calcium)
• Screen and manage underlying osteoporosis
• Referral for incapacitating or persistent pain > 4-6 wks. (PM&R, ortho spine, 
interventional radiology) →vertebral augmentation

Page 15:
Spondylosis: Etiology
• Nonspecific, degenerative changes of the spine affecting the discs, 
vertebral bodies and joints
• Often w/ osteophyte formation
• Degenerative changes of facet (zygapophyseal) joint = “facet arthritis” 
• Joint space narrowing, sclerosis, and hypertrophy
• Degenerative disc disease (DDD)
• Reduced hydration and elasticity of the disc & cartilage → leads to 
reduced ability of disc to sustain and transmit forces
• May have assoc. disc bulge

Spinal Stenosis
• Narrowing of the central spinal canal leading to mechanical 
compression and ischemia of nerve roots
• Foraminal stenosis – narrowing of the intervertebral foramen affecting 
the exiting spinal nerve
• Can occur at any level
• Greater incidence in lumbar spine followed by cervical spine
• Combination of factors can lead to stenosis
• Disc, ligament, and/or bony pathology
• Less commonly due to space occupying lesion, fibrosis, or 
congenital/developmental abnormalities

Page 34:
Radiculopathy: Presentation
• Pain, paresthesia, and/or weakness in specific nerve distribution
• (+/-) Decrease or loss of deep tendon reflexes (DTRs)

symptomatic side
• Reverse SLR (femoral stretch) → patient prone or side lying, extend hip/leg, 
best for eval of L1-4 radicular sxs

rotation/extension/compression reproduces UE pain and/or paresthesia

Page 35:
Myelopathy

pathologic reflexes, gait disturbance, clumsy 
movements

shock-like sensation either down the back or into an 
extremity

Diagnostics: Radiographs
When to order radiographs?
• Back/neck pain not improving >4-6 weeks
• With or without radicular symptoms
• Concern for vertebral compression fracture
• Concern for spondylolysis
• Not improving after 2-4 wks. of activity reduction
