OBJECTIVES
• Compare and contrast the following musculoskeletal (MSK) imaging modalities: plain 
radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scan, 
DXA and ultrasound
• Outline a systematic approach to musculoskeletal imaging as outlined in this lecture.
• Describe a fracture in terms of site, anatomic location, fracture pattern, extent of injury, 
and amount of displacement.
• Define and identify basic fracture patterns on radiograph: transverse, oblique, spiral, 
comminuted, segmental, torus, compression, greenstick, bowing.
• Identify basic fracture fragment displacement qualities including angulation, translation, and 
displacement. 
• Identify concerning clinical findings for open fractures and recommend appropriate 
management.

MUSCULOSKELETAL (MSK) IMAGING
• In addition to history/physical exam findings, radiographic modalities 
allow viewing of internal structures to guide treatment
• Ionizing vs Non-ionizing methods
– Soft tissue (muscle, fat)
– Ligaments, tendons, etc
– Bones
What does “ionizing radiation” mean?
Radiation that penetrates tissue and 
alters/damages DNA, which potentially increases 
cancer risk (more so in children / fetal tissue)

Page 6:
MSK IMAGING METHODS
IONIZING
• Plain Radiography (Xrays)
• Computed Tomography (CT)
– CT Arthrography
• Nuclear Scintigraphy (bone scan)
• Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry 
(DXA)
NON-IONIZING
• Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
– MR arthography
• Ultrasound

• Images obtained by projecting x-ray beams (radiation) through a subject onto an 
image detector (film or digital)
– Dense tissues/objects absorb more radiation (fewer beams pass through to detector) 
these tissues appear white / “radiopaque”
– Less-dense tissues have more radiation pass through  appears darker / “radiolucent”

RADIOGRAPHY AKA X-RAY
INDICATIONS
• First-line for many MSK conditions
– Inexpensive, widely-available 
outpatient, quick result
– Typically ordered prior to more 
advanced imaging (CT scan, MRI)
• Many specific indications:
– Trauma (fractures, dislocations), 
tumors, arthritis, etc. 
• Images can be viewed immediately* 
with preliminary interpretation
CONSIDERATIONS
• Small amount of radiation (less 
than CT scan)
• Children / Pregnancy = not a 
contraindication if needed, but 
consider alternative method
• May not be diagnostic for 
exclusively soft tissue injuries
11
*Look at your own films

RADIOGRAPHY VIEWS
• Based on direction of Xray beam traveling from emitter through tissue toward 
detector
– Posterior/Anterior (PA) – beam travels posterior to anterior
• Ex. PA chest = beam passes from back to chest
– Anterior/Posterior (AP) – beam travels anterior to posterior
• Ex. AP chest = beam passes from chest to back

Page 14:
RADIOGRAPHY VIEWS, CONT’D
• Based on direction of Xray beam traveling from emitter through 
tissue toward detector
– Lateral – beam travels from one side of the body to the other
– Obliques – beam angled to the transverse or coronal plane
– Site-specific views (ankle mortise, swimmer’s view, weight bearing, etc)
• Obtain at least 2 views on Xray to fully evaluate for fractures
– “One view is no view”

Page 16:
COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT)
• CT scan takes multiple x-rays rapidly to 
recreate internal structures 
– Images can be manipulated to improve 
view (“windows” / slices)
• Iodine-based contrast enhances 
tissue density differences 
– IV, oral, rectal forms of contrast

Page 17:
CT VIEWS = ANATOMICAL PLANES
Planes:
– Axial/Transverse: horizontal 
slices (Divides Superior and 
Inferior)
– Coronal: Longitudinal slice 
(Divides Anterior and 
Posterior)
– Sagittal: Longitudinal slice 
(Divides Right and Left)

CT VIEWS Interpretation:
• A Axial: looking from the patient’s feet toward the head
– “Feet at your face” – looking at the image towards the patients’ head  
– ALWAYS
• B Coronal: patient is facing you
• C Sagittal: Looking from the side

Page 21:
CT - INDICATIONS* 
• Excellent diagnostic accuracy, specifically for bones:
– Occult/subtle fractures not visible on radiography 
– Assess fracture healing (especially if concerned for non-union / lack of healing)
– Fully evaluate complex fractures or polytraumatic injuries  
• CT arthrogram
– Contrast is directly injected into joint (sterile technique) to identify intra-articular loose 
bodies or specific issues
• Not very common
*Multiple other indications

Page 22:
RADIATION RISK
• Despite accuracy, CT scan is not first-line MSK imaging modality in 
most cases
– High radiation compared to radiography
– Expensive, non-portable
– Certain contraindications (next slide)
• For certain settings, CT scan may be first line or indicated after 
initial XRay: 
– Major, high-energy trauma (significant force)
– Complex fractures, open fracture, joint involvement identified on XRay

Page 23:
CT SCAN – CONSIDERATIONS
• True allergy to contrast dye (iodinated)
– Allergy to contrast = urticaria / hives, facial edema, bronchospasm
• Side effects of contrast = nausea, sweating/hot flashes
– Shellfish, topical iodine allergy are not cross-reactive with contrast
• Decreased renal function / kidney disease
• Significant metal in area to be imaged can create artifact 
(streaking that obscures view - pictured)
• Pregnancy
– Harm to fetal tissue depends on gestational age and dose of radiation; consider MRI / 
ultrasound if appropriate
• Patient habitus
– Diameter of CT scanner; table weight limit (esp if >300 lb)
• Clinical tip: Know weight limit of tables + scales at your facility

Page 24:
DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY 
ABSORPTIOMETRY (DXA)
• Bone strength determined by bone mineral 
density (BMD)
– BMD is decreased in osteoporosis; loss is associated with increased bone 
fracture risk
• Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans
– Two x-ray beams at different energy levels are passed through specific locations of 
patient bones (hip / wrist / spine); tissue absorption is subtracted and bone 
density is estimated
– Resultant calculation is compared to population and age matched values (Z/T 
scores)

Page 25:
DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY 
ABSORPTIOMETRY (DXA)
• Information from DXA scans is used to:
– Diagnose osteoporosis or low bone mineral density (BMD),
• Through screening or for evaluation of other conditions
• T-scores / Z-scores
– Estimate future fracture risk
– Monitor effectiveness of treatments to prevent bone density loss

Page 26:
BONE SCINTIGRAPHY (BONE SCAN)
• Nuclear medicine technique
– Very sensitive for evaluating 
hyperactive bone activity
• “Hot spots” = areas of increased 
bone activity / remodeling 
(radioisotope tracer)
– Bony malignancy / tumors
– Infection, fractures
– Radiation exposure depends on 
specific study
26Case courtesy of Dr Henry Knipe, Radiopaedia.org, rID: 31380

Page 27:
BONE SCAN
INDICATIONS
• Bone metastases 
– Cancer spread to bone
• Primary bone tumors 
– Cancer starting in bone
• Osteomyelitis 
– Bacterial bone infection
• Occult (hidden) fractures

Page 28:
MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI)
• Uses a strong magnetic field with 
radiofrequency pulses that are transmitted to 
receiver coils 
– No ionizing radiation
• Detects changes in tissue water content 
(inflammation, neoplasm, ischemia, etc), and 
computer collects differences in tissue signals 
(T1 vs T2) & recreates image of structures
• Gadoliunium-based contrast has less
potential for allergy, renal problems
• Lengthy exam time, $$, noisy
• May require medication for claustrophobia
28
Case courtesy of Dr Roberto Schubert, Radiopaedia.org, rID: 16703

Page 29:
MRI
INDICATIONS
• Best for evaluating of non-bony tissue
– Meniscus, articular cartilage, ligaments, 
tendons, brain, spinal cord, etc.
• Can also provide bony detail if not 
visible/detailed on CT scan
– Avascular necrosis, osteomyelitis, 
malignancy
• MR arthrogram
– Contrast is directly injected into joint
(sterile technique)
– Detects complex soft tissue injuries or 
labral tears 29

MRI
CONTRAINDICATIONS
• Unstable/uncooperative patient
• Inability to lay flat / tolerate position
• Ferromagnetic materials
– Beds, oxygen tanks, crash carts, keys, etc.
– Metallic objects in body (metal foreign body, some 
tattoo inks, bullets, piercings, shotgun pellets, etc)
– Certain pacemakers, implanted cardiac valves, clips, 
cochlear implants…
• Many newer implants are not ferromagnetic, but can 
cause artifact on image; check with manufacturer

Page 31:
ULTRASOUND
• Sound waves are transmitted into 
tissues and images are produced by 
the “bounceback” of soundwaves 
transmitted to the ultrasound 
transducer
– No ionizing radiation
– Doppler ultrasound measures blood 
flow (vascular studies)

Page 32:
ULTRASOUND
INDICATIONS
• Frequently used in children / 
pregnant women for multiple 
conditions
• Best for soft tissue conditions 
(tendons and muscles)
– Minimal use in evaluating bone
• Guided assistance for joint injections, 
biopsies, soft tissue drainage
CONTRAINDICATIONS
• Few if any; patient preference
• Operator / skill dependent

Page 33:
MUSCULOSKELETAL IMAGING
• Choice of Imaging:
1. Clinical presentation: history, mechanism of injury (MOI), location of pain
2. Differential Diagnoses / Urgency of study
3. Availability of imaging modalities
• American College of Radiology (ACR) publishes guidelines for 
imaging
– https://www.acr.org/Clinical-Resources/ACR-Appropriateness-Criteria
• Plain radiography is the initial imaging of choice for most
MSK conditions

FIRST STEPS WITH RADIOGRAPHS
• Fracture = disruption of structural continuity of bony cortex; a “break” in a bone
– Fractures can be complete (fully through entire bone) or incomplete (partially through bone)
• When viewing fracture radiographs, make sure of the following:
– Is this the correct patient and correct study?
• Identity, laterality, study date
• Correct view and orientation
• Know your patient; be prepared to discuss history
– What do I expect to find?
– Does this match the clinical history? 
– Describe what you see
• Name of bone, fracture location, fracture pattern, position of bone

Page 36:
AT THE END OF THIS LECTURE, MY GOALS FOR 
YOU ARE TO BE ABLE TO:
Answer the following questions for an XRay:
1. What is this bone? 
2. Is it broken?
3. Where in the bone is it broken and how (type of 
fracture)?
4. Describe what you see to a specialist. 
5. Decipher a basic radiology report.

OPEN FRACTURES
• When evaluating acute injuries with possible 
fractures, closely evaluate skin integrity
– Remove clothing, splints, bandages
– Open fracture = fracture with bone fragments that 
penetrate overlying skin
– Cannot reliably exclude open fracture based on Xray 
• ANY skin wound / puncture near fracture should 
be evaluated as an open fracture
– If a fracture is open, or could be  lead with this 
information when communicating to specialist
– Open fractures require urgent evaluation by 
orthopedics + needs IV antibiotics / surgery 38

INCOMPLETE FRACTURES
• Incomplete fractures = break is not 
completely through bone
• More common in children (pliable 
periosteum)
– Bowing: Bending of bone without breaking
– Greenstick: Partial-thickness fracture; 
cortex/periosteum interrupted on one side
– Torus / Buckle: Axial load causes 
“buckling” of cortex and periosteum

IMPORTANT CONCEPTS FOR ORDERING 
MEDICAL IMAGING
• When ordering radiographs/medical imaging:
– Who is this patient?
• What medical conditions do they have? Medications? Contraindications?
– Why am I ordering this?
• Be very specific with the reason for the order
• Consider if this is the right modality
– What is the mechanism of injury or disease process?
• What am I expecting to see?
– When did the injury / symptom occur?
• Compare with old images if present
– How quickly does this study need to happen?

Page 75:
SUMMARY
Be systematic
Document vascular and 
neuro status of distal 
region
Verify the patient
Obtain quality films
– Multiple correct views
– Joint visualization
Systematically identity fractures
– Compare to unaffected side as needed
Describe fractures as accurately as possible
– Location
– Orientation / Pattern / Segments
– Position / Displacement
83
*Look at your own films and correlate findings with clinical exam
Clinical pearl: if you are sending the patient to 
the ED and the patient is agreeable, call ahead
and leave your contact info if the ED provider 
wishes to speak with you.
