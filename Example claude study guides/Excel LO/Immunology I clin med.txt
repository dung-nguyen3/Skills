Innate Immune System: Complement
System
• Part of the innate immune system that enhances or "complements"
antibodies and immune cells to clear microbes and damaged cells
• Comprised of 50+ circulating plasma proteins that are activated in a
cascade-like manner in response to a pathogen
• These proteins work together to trigger inflammation, promote
opsonization and directly kill pathogens by forming a membrane
attack complex (MAC)
16
--- PAGE 17 ---
Sequence of Events in Complement System
1. Activation through either classical, lectin or alternative pathways
2. Formation of the enzyme C3 convertase
3. Formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC)
4. Lysis of microbe
17
--- PAGE 18 ---
Complement System:
3 Activation Pathways
• Classical Pathway:
• Triggered by antibodies (such as IgM and IgG) binding to an antigen
• Lectin Pathway: Lectin proteins bind to mannose residues on the microbial surface
• Alternative Pathway: Complement proteins act directly on cell surfaces
All 3 of these pathways leads to the formation of the
membrane attack complex (MAC)

Alternate Pathway
C3 convertase
C3
Classic Pathway
C1 binds to an antigen-antibody
complex on an invading
pathogen, causing complement
components C2 and C4 to
split in two.
Fragments from C2 and C4 combine to
form an enzyme called C3 convertase.
C3 convertase splits C3 in two. One of
the fragments from C3 joins C3
convertase to form C5 convertase.
C3b
C3a
C5
C5 convertase splits C5 in two.
Endogenous
proteins protect
host cells from lysis.
MAC
A fragment from C5 joins C6, C7, C8, and C9
to form a complex that makes a hole in the
plasma membrane of the invading cell.
The cell
swells and bursts.
Invading pathogen
C3 convertase cleaves C3, the most
abundant complement protein
19
--- PAGE 20 ---
Immune Effects of Complement Proteins
Opsonization
• Complement proteins (C3b) coat the surface of the antigen to activate
neutrophils and macrophages, resulting in phagocytosis
Cell Lysis
• Complement proteins form a membrane attack complex (MAC) to attack the
pathogen's cell membrane, resulting in bacterial cell wall rupture
Enhances Inflammation
• Using chemotaxis, neutrophils and macrophages migrate to the area where
antigen is present
• Activate mast cells and basophils, which are mediators of inflammation through
the release of histamine
20
--- PAGE 21 ---
Opsonization and Phagocytosis
Opsonization = The coating of a
microbe by an antibody (or
complement protein) to "tag" it
for phagocytosis
Phagocytosis = Mechanism by
which host cells engulf and
destroy an organism

Complex (MAC) and Cell Lysis

Cell Membrane
Intracellular Space
C9
C9
• MAC is a complex of complement proteins
that bind to the outer surface of the pathogen
plasma membrane
• C5b, c6, c7, c8 and c9 are the proteins that
bind to form the MAC
• The ring formed by many copies of C9 creates
a pore in the membrane
• Once these proteins combine on the surface
of a pathogen's cell membrane, the cell wall
ruptures

Innate Immune System: Inflammation
• Produces inflammatory mediators
• Cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor)
• Chemokines
• Histamine released from mast cells and basophils
• Induces blood vessel dilation
• Recruits immune cells
• Complement proteins, such as C3a, attract neutrophils to the area to assist
in pathogen destruction
• Promotes tissue repair after infection clears
• Produces growth factors

Acute Inflammatory Response
   1. Pathogen present, tissue damage, Complement activated
   2. Chemical signals (chemotaxis) alert endothelial cells along the capillary wall
   3. Neutrophils become "sticky" and stop rolling along the capillary wall
   4. Mast cells release histamine
   5. Histamine causes vasodilation and openings in between endothelial cells
   6. Fluid and leukocytes enter the affected tissue
   7. Neutrophils "squeeze" through endothelium (=extravasation)
   8. Neutrophils are attracted to the damaged site and ingest/destroy bacteria

WBC: Basophils
• Play a supporting role in allergic and antigen response
• Release granules that contain
      1. Histamine (increases blood flow to the area, makes
blood vessels more permeable so neutrophils can enter
tissues)
      2. Heparin (reduces clotting and promotes movement
of WBCs into an area)
38
--- PAGE 39 ---
WBC: Eosinophils
• Target larger parasites (helminths) that are too large
for one WBC to phagocytize
• Degranulate, releasing cytotoxic granules containing
proteins that damage and destroy the parasite
• Predominant inflammatory cell in allergic reactions
• Rare in the blood, but numerous in the mucous
membranes of the respiratory, digestive, and lower
urinary tracts
• Causes of eosinophilia: Asthma, allergic rhinitis, hives,
parasitic infections
39
--- PAGE 40 ---
WBC: Mast Cells
• Release histamine and heparin
• Present in barrier tissues (mucosa); Do not circulate in
the blood
• Play important roles in allergy and anaphylaxis
reactions
• With stimulation by an allergen, they release contents
of granules and produce allergic reactions
40
--- PAGE 41 ---
WBC: Monocytes
• Spend a short time in the blood before migrating
into the tissues (spleen, liver, lungs and bone
marrow) to become macrophages and dendritic cells
Macrophages:
• Large phagocytic cells that engulf and destroy
pathogens, cellular debris and damaged cells
• Act as antigen-presenting cells
Dendritic cells:
• Act as antigen-presenting cells

The Function of the Lymphatic System
• Component of the circulatory system
• Includes lymph, lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, lymphatic cells and
lymphoid organs
• Balances volume of interstitial fluid and supports the immune
system in surveillance and defense

Defining
Primary and Secondary Lymphatic Organs
Primary lymphatic organs:
Where lymphocytes are formed and mature
Secondary lymphatic organs:
Tissues arranged in a series of filters that monitor the
contents of lymph, tissue fluid and blood. Lymphocytes are
activated in these organs.

The Role of the Spleen During Infection
Spleen function in infection:
Encapsulated pathogens are opsonized with antibodies and then
phagocytosed by specialized macrophages in the spleen
In asplenia or functional asplenia:
• Since splenic functions are lost or reduced, the patient is at risk for
bacteremia caused by encapsulated bacteria.
With vaccinations against
encapsulated bacteria, over time, memory B cells can build up in the lymph
nodes.
This provides protection against encapsulated bacteria.
See References and Resources section for etiologies of asplenia and functional asplenia
59
--- PAGE 60 ---
Clinical Application: Asplenia
Modest increase in circulating white blood cells and platelets
Mild leukocytosis and thrombocytosis
Consider daily prophylaxis with penicillin
               * Increased susceptibility to infection caused by encapsulated bacteria:
               1. Streptococcus pneumoniae
               2. Haemophilus influenzae (Hib)
               3. Neisseria meningitides
Vaccines recommended!
See References and Resources section for list of encapsulated bacteria
