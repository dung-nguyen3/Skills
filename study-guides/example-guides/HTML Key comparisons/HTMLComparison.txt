# Master Comparison Tables Tab

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Verbatim Objectives**: Copy every learning objective exactly as written. Look for: "Learning Objectives:", "Objectives:", "By the end of...", "Goals:". Do not paraphrase.
2. **Source Only**: Use only the provided files. If information is missing, write: `[Not specified in file]`.
3. **No External Knowledge**: Do not add information not explicitly stated in the files.

## STEP 1: EXTRACT AND ORGANIZE CONTENT

### Find Objectives
- Search for "Learning Objectives:", "Objectives:", "By the end of...", "Goals:". Copy verbatim. Number as LO1, LO2, ...

###  Tab 1: Key Comparisons  
- **Purpose:** Focused side-by-side comparisons for specific topic groups
- **Content:** Detailed comparison tables for related conditions (e.g., "White Lesions Comparison", "Viral vs Bacterial Pharyngitis")

When creating Key Comparisons tab:
1. Prioritize comparisons students frequently confuse
2. Focus on actionable clinical decisions (not just theory)
3. Include SPECIFIC treatments with EXACT dosing (never vague)
4. Use treatment-focused tables (what to prescribe in each scenario)
5. Include age-based and severity-based algorithms
6. Highlight hallmark/pathognomonic findings
7. Provide "if-then" clinical decision rules
8. Include urgency levels for referrals/complications
9. Use consistent formatting throughout
10. End with high-yield summary pearls
11. Multiple side by side comparison table charts. Each table chart should compare 1-2 category  at a time to help break it down and differentiate. (For example: If comparing Clinical Presentation, Diagnosis, and Treatment for Condition A, B, C, create one chart comparing clinical presentation in Conditions A, B, and C. Create a separate chart to compare treatment for conditions A, B, and C, and so on. 


### Tab 2: Master Comparison Tables 
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive "everything in one place" reference tables
- **Content:** COMPLETE differential diagnosis or drug tables consolidating ALL conditions from the lecture

### 🔍 Tab 4: Summary
- **Purpose:** High-level rapid review with mnemonics and pearls
- **Content:** One-sentence summaries, mnemonics, "If You See X Think Y" , critical values, key definitions, treatment modalities
- **When to use:** For quick review before exams or clinical encounters

## Example Structure

### Red Eye Lecture Would Have:


**Tab 1 (Key Comparisons):**
- Viral vs Bacterial vs Allergic Conjunctivitis (detailed 3-way comparison)
- Episcleritis vs Scleritis (focused 2-way comparison)
- Preseptal vs Orbital Cellulitis (focused 2-way comparison)

**Tab 2 (Master Comparison Tables):**
- **Complete Red Eye Differential Diagnosis** (ALL 14+ conditions in one massive table)
  - Rows: Viral conjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, corneal abrasion, corneal ulcer, episcleritis, scleritis, iritis, acute angle-closure glaucoma, hyphema, chemical burn, preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis
  - Columns: Vision, Pain, Discharge, Pupil, IOP, Key Features, Management
- **Quick Reference: When to Refer to Ophthalmology** (urgent vs routine referrals)

**Tab 3. (Summary):**
- One-sentence summaries
- Mnemonics (e.g., "FEVER" for corneal ulcer features)
- "If you see X, Think Y"
- Critical IOP values
- Key definitions (hyphema, hypopyon, ciliary flush)
- Final high-yield pearls

For medical conditions files, All Tabs should have information related to the learning 
objectives. 

For pharmacology/drug files, all tabs should have information related to the drugs that the user mentioned or if not mentioned then drugs in the source file.

## Formatting Tips

### Color-Coding Emergency Level
```html
<!-- Emergency (red tint) -->
<tr style="background: #ffebee;">
    <td><strong>Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma</strong></td>
    <td><span class="highlight-red">Severely decreased</span></td>
    ...
</tr>

<!-- Urgent (orange tint) -->
<tr style="background: #fff3e0;">
    <td><strong>Corneal Ulcer</strong></td>
    <td>Decreased</td>
    ...
</tr>

<!-- Routine (white) -->
<tr>
    <td><strong>Viral Conjunctivitis</strong></td>
    <td>Normal</td>
    ...
</tr>
```

### Inline Highlighting
- `<span class="highlight-red">EMERGENCY</span>` - Life-threatening
- `<span class="highlight-yellow">URGENT</span>` - Time-sensitive
- `<span class="highlight-purple">Pathognomonic sign</span>` - Diagnostic feature
- `<span class="highlight-blue">Distinguishing feature</span>` - Differentiating finding
- `<span class="highlight-green">Normal value</span>` - Expected range

### Spacing Between Tables
```html
<h3 style="margin-top: 40px;"> Next Topic Complete Comparison</h3>
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Reference:** Students see EVERYTHING in one place
2. **Emergency Recognition:** Red/orange backgrounds immediately highlight critical conditions
3. **Pattern Recognition:** Side-by-side viewing helps identify distinguishing features
4. **Efficient Review:** One table = entire differential diagnosis
5. **Clinical Decision Support:** "When to Refer" tables guide appropriate consultation
