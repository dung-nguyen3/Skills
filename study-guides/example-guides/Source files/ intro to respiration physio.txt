LO3: Conducting zone
• Role is to move air into/out of
respiratory zone for gas exchange
• Functions:
• humidification and warming of air stream
• decreases velocity of airflow
• Regulation of airway resistance
Smooth muscle
• removal of dust
Cilia and mucous secreting (goblet) cells

--- PAGE 11 ---
LO4: How does the ANS control
conducting airway tone?
• Smooth muscle of bronchi and bronchioles is controlled by the ANS
SNS → adrenergic $\beta_{2}$ receptor activation on bronchial smooth muscle • airway dilation
• What happens to airway resistance?
decreases
PNS → cholinergic $M_{3}$ receptor activation on bronchial smooth muscle
• Airway constriction
• What happens to airway resistance?
increases

LO5: Mucociliary transport
• Effective clearance requires both ciliary activity and respiratory tract fluids (periciliary fluid and mucus)
•
Ciliated cells produce periciliary fluid (SOL LAYER) with low viscosity that is optimal for ciliary activity
Goblet cells produce mucus $(5-10~\mu m$ thick GEL LAYER, distributed in patches) that has a high viscosity and high elastic properties and trap inhaled materials

Preview: Pulmonary vasculature
Pulmonary artery receives all of the right heart output
Pulmonary blood pressure is low (arterial pressure ~15 mmHg)
Since cardiac output is still $5-6L/min$ what does this mean for surface area of entire pulmonary circulation?
Large surface area, low resistance
Pulmonary blood flow not distributed evenly when we're standing
Due to gravity
Lowest at top of lung and highest at bottom of lung

$\dot{V}_{X}=\frac{D\times A\times\Delta P}{\Delta X}$

$A=$ surface area
$\Delta P=$ partial pressure difference of the gas $\Delta X=$ membrane thickness

Diffusion inversely proportional to:

affect gas diffusion rate
What do you think would happen to the rate of gas diffusion for the following conditions and why?
               1. Increased fibrotic tissue in the respiratory zone of the lung due to restrictive lung disease?
Decreased, due to increased diffusion distance
               2. A lung resection due to removal of a cancerous lung lobe?
Decreased, due to decreased surface area
               3. A person visits Cuzco, Peru?

               4. Your friend goes for a run?

LO8: Tidal volume
Humans use tidal ventilation
air moves bidirectionally into and out of lungs by same path
How do we adjust for increased metabolic demand during exercise?
We can adjust breathing rate, or tidal volume
•
Tidal volume = amount of air that
moves in and out per breath during normal breathing

LO8: What's the challenge with tidal breathing?
• The airway (150 ml, grey square) contains air that must be inhaled before any fresh inspired air (500 ml, blue rectangle) can be brought into the lungs
• Dead space is primarily the air in the conducting airways (more details about dead space in lecture 34)
• Tidal volume must account for dead space volume so that enough fresh air is brought in to supply sufficient oxygen for gas exchange
