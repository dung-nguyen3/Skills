TRANSFUSION REACTIONS
• Transfusion reactions causes:
• Immune reactions, involving antibodies, antigens, and complement
• Other causes include bacteria or factors related to massive transfusion
(coagulopathy, volume, hypothermia, mechanical injury of red cells)
• Most common transfusion reaction is febrile, non-hemolytic ( $1^{\circ}$ C above
baseline)

HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA OVERVIEW
Hemolytic anemia = premature RBC destruction
RBC lifespan 120 days $(1\%loss/day)$
Bone marrow can compensate 5X increase loss/day.
Anemia when $>5\%loss/day$
Parvo B19 can cause aplastic anemia
Types of hemolysis
•
Intracorpuscular (cell) vs extracorpuscular (environment)
Intravascular vs extravascular (spleen)

• G6PD helps RBC handle oxidative
stress. G6PD Deficiency→ lysis of RBC
• Common in people of Mediterranean
and African descent

NORMOCYTIC HEMOLYTIC ANEΜΙΑ
G6PD DEFICIENCY
Symptoms range: $none/mild$ to severe
Oxidative stress triggers hemolysis
• Infection is most common
• Many drugs implicated:
primaquine, aspirin, nitrofurantoin, phenazopyridine,
sulfonamides, ribavirin, dapsone
• Fava beans
• Metabolic acidosis

G6PD DEFICIENCY CLINICAL FEATURES
• Most people with G6PD are asymptomatic. RBC lifespan mildly
decreased.
• May become symptomatic 2-4 days after exposure to
offending drug.
Chronic hemolysis is rare. Episodic.

• Microalbuminuria annually starting at 10 yo
• HbSS and HbSBO
• PCN prophylaxis daily for <5 years old

He has narrowly survived
numerous bouts of fever and coughing.

HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA
• Mostly intracorpuscular and extravascular
• Tend to show high unconjugated bilirubin, high LDH, low haptoglobin
• G6PD is x-linked, avoid oxidative stress, remember fava beans and
Heinz bodies (splenectomy)
• Hereditary spherocytosis can be treated with splenectomy
• Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia have +DAT
• MAHA = schistocytes
60

SICKLE CELL ANEMIA
• Autosomal Recessive = HbSS
• Hemoglobin electrophoresis or genetics for dx
• Trait is asymptomatic
• Avoid oxidative stress
• Thromboses are common
• Pain is common
• Vaccinate for encapsulated organisms
• PCN prophylaxis until age 5 (fully vaccinated)

ΑΝΕΜΙΑ
WBC and platelet normal, Check
Reticulocyte
Anemia and low WBC and low PLT:
Pancytopenia. consider primary or
secondary bone marrow dysfunction
Anemia and Low PLT: consider
MAHA or autoimmune hemolytic
anemia
Low reticulocyte,
Check MCV
High reticulocyte: consider chronic blood loss or
increased destruction/hemolysis
Check DAT and check peripheral
smear for schistocytes
Adapted from Symptom to Diagnosis: An Evidence-Based Guide
If DAT positive,
consider autoimmune
hemolytic anemia
DAT Negative
Consider Hereditary: sickle cell,
spherocytosis, G6PD
Consider Acquired: hypersplenism,
drug-induced, infection, toxin
