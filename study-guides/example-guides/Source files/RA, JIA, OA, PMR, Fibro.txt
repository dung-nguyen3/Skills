Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): 
Overview 
◦ Chronic, systemic, autoimmune, inflammatory 
disease of unknown etiology 
◦ Primarily involves synovial joints
◦ Symmetrical polyarthritis is typical 
◦ Affects ~ 1 % of the population
◦ Women > Men (3:1 ratio)
◦ Peak onset is between 35 and 50 years
◦ Untreated, RA causes joint destruction
◦ In addition to affecting joints, RA can also have 
systemic extraarticular manifestations

Page 7:
Rheumatoid Arthritis:  
Pathogenesis
◦ Complex interaction between genes and 
environment!
◦ E.g., smoking, altered microbiome
◦ Leads to synovial inflammation (synovitis)
◦ The synovium organizes itself into an 
invasive tissue →
◦ Can lead to erosion of bone, cartilage, 
ligaments, and tendon

Page 8:
Rheumatoid Arthritis: 
Clinical Presentation
◦ Typically, a polyarticular disease
◦ Gradual onset is more common
◦ Progresses from periphery to proximal
◦ Small joints of the hands, wrists, and 
forefoot common in early disease
◦ Difficulty performing activities of daily 
living (ADL’s)
◦ Disease activity: natural exacerbations 
(“flares”) and reduced disease activity
◦ Constitutional symptoms may be 
present
◦ Myalgias, fatigue, low-grade fever, weight 
loss, poor sleep

LABORATORY TESTING

Page 23:
Laboratory 
Studies in RA
◦ Abnormal labs reflect the presence of 
systemic and intraarticular inflammation 
and the autoimmune features of RA. 
◦ Laboratory Tests: 
◦ Rheumatoid factor (RF)
◦ Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-
CCP) antibodies 
◦ Antinuclear antibody (ANA)
◦ CBC
◦ ESR/CRP
◦ Synovial fluid analysis

Page 24:
Rheumatoid Factor & Anti-CCP Antibodies
24
RHEUMATOID FACTOR (RF) ANTI-CCP ANTIBODIES
75-80% of patients with RA test positive for RF, Anti-CCP antibodies (ACPA), or both
Improved sensitivity and specificity 
Presence of RF or Anti-CCP antibodies predicts poorer functional and radiographic 
outcomes
Order Both
ACPA = anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ELISA for antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) is the most commonly used assay for ACPA)

Page 25:
Other Diagnostics Helpful 
in the Work-Up for RA
◦ ESR/CRP: elevated with active disease
◦ Often parallels the activity of the disease
◦ CBC
◦ May reveal indicators of inflammation
◦ Anemia of chronic disease, thrombocytosis, mild 
leukocytosis
◦ Arthrocentesis (removal of joint synovial fluid)
◦ Diagnosis or exclusion of gout, pseudogout, 
infection, etc. 
◦ Synovial fluid analysis
◦ Usually reveals an inflammatory effusion25
ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate (“sed rate”); CRP = C-reactive protein

*Of note: Seronegative RA (lack both RF

◦ Cartilage
◦ Synovium
◦ Bone
◦ Ligaments

Joint Changes in OA
◦Progressive loss and destruction of cartilage
◦Over time, joint space narrows
◦ Synovium
◦ Inflamed synovial membrane
◦ Bony changes of the joint
◦Marginal osteophytes (bone spurs) 
◦ Subchondral bone thickening, cysts
◦ Soft-tissues
◦ Thickening of the joint capsule, tears in ligaments
◦ Periarticular muscles and nerves are also affected 
by OA resulting in weakness and pain

Page 68:
Polymyalgia 
Rheumatica 
(PMR): 
Overview
◦ Relatively common, chronic inflammatory rheumatic 
condition of unknown etiology
◦ Characterized clinically by aching and morning stiffness 
of the shoulders, neck, & pelvic girdle
◦ Strong association with giant cell arteritis (GCA)
◦ Predominately those > 50 years of age
◦ Prevalence increases progressively with advancing age
◦ Women are affected 2-3x more often than men
◦ Annual incidence is highest in Scandinavian countries 
and in people of northern European descent

Page 69:
PMR: 
Cause is 
Unknown
◦ An autoimmune process may play a role in PMR
◦ Genetic predisposition (HLA types)
◦ Possible environmental factors (i.e., virus ?)
◦ The muscle in PMR is histopathologically normal
◦ The symptoms of PMR result from inflammation of 
the joint and surrounding tissues (bursae and 
tendons): 
◦ Example: Bilateral subdeltoid/subacromial bursitis 
(imaging hallmark of PMR)

Page 70:
PMR: Clinical Presentation
◦ Often, a recent, discrete change in sx
◦ Bilateral shoulder pain (nearly all patients)
◦ Neck and pelvic girdle pain (50 to 70%)
◦ Morning stiffness (>1 hr)
◦ Stiffness with prolonged inactivity (gel 
phenomenon)
◦ Functional limitations (ADLs)
◦ Systemic symptoms
◦ Malaise, fatigue, low-grade fever

Page 71:
PMR: Physical Examination
◦ Limited (restricted) ROM
◦ Limitation of active abduction of 
shoulders is common
◦ Normal muscle strength
◦ Subjective weakness
◦ Clinical synovitis at the peripheral joints

Initial Treatment 
for PMR
◦ Low-dose prednisone (e.g., 10-20

◦ Subsequently, the dose is gradually
