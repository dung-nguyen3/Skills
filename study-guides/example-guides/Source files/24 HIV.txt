Lecture Objectives
1. Be able to discuss the life cycle of HIV, and recognize that HIV is a retrovirus (RNA) that
requires reverse transcriptase to form DNA which can then integrate into host DNA.
2. Recognize that the treatment of HIV requires multiple antiretroviral drugs.
3. Be familiar with Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTIs) class of retroviral
drugs and their common mechanism of action (but difference in which nucleotide they are
an analogue for), adverse side effects
4. Recognize that NRTIs have both drug-specific and common adverse side effects.
5. Be familiar with the NNRTIs, and how their mechanism of action is different than NRTIs.
6. Recall which NNRTI is teratogenic, and which NNRTI is safe in pregnancy.
7. Recall the drugs that comprise the Protease Inhibitor class of antiretrovirals, and their
common mechanism of action.
8. Recognize the common adverse effects and common pharmacokinetics of PIs and the
potential for drug interactions that will influence the metabolism of protease inhibitors.
9. Describe the use of ritonavir (Norvir) in HIV therapy, and why it should (or shouldn’t) be
prescribed with other PIs.
10. Discuss why you wouldn’t use two PIs in individuals with sulfonamide hypersensitivities.
11. Recall the specific adverse side effects associated with each PI.
12. Explain the unique mechanism of action for Fusion Inhibitors, recall the two drugs in this
class, and when these drugs should be used.
13. Discuss the mechanism of action for Dolutegravir, an integrase inhibitor, and its
importance in treating treatment-resistant patients.

---

## PAGE 19: Protease Inhibitors - Mechanism

**MOA**: PI bind to proteases inhibiting their function: which is to digest long viral polypeptides into smaller, mature functional proteins. Viral particles are unable to mature and become infectious.

**Detailed diagram shows**:
- Multi-protein molecule inside immature viral particle
- Protease enzyme attempting to cleave proteins
- Protease inhibitor (red shape) blocking the enzyme
- Without inhibitor: individual core proteins and viral RNA are released, allowing subsequent maturation of virus particles as infectious
- With inhibitor: protease is prevented from releasing individual core proteins, preventing maturation of virus particles as infectious

---

## PAGE 20: Protease Inhibitors - Common Pharmacokinetics

- Oral
- Mutations and resistance common if used alone: **combine with NRTIs**
- **PIs are metabolized by CYP3A4** – often given with ritonavir or cobicistat, which is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 to increase PI blood levels for lower dose/less frequent dosing
- **Many drug interactions:**
  - Drugs which induce CYP3A4 will decrease PI levels (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, …)
  - **St. John's Wort – do not use, increases metabolism of PIs!**

**Highlighted box** shows drug-to-drug interactions are a key challenge in HIV/TB co-infection, as TB treatments can impact effectiveness of HIV medicines.

---

## PAGE 21: Pharmacokinetic Enhancers

- GI - vomiting, weakness and diarrhea
- Burning, tingling, elevated liver enzymes, nausea
- Formulation contains ethanol; do not give with metronidazole, cephalosporins

**Cobicistat (Tybost)**

- Hepatic, CNS (headache, dreams), rash

**Diagram shows**: 
- Mechanism: CYP3A4 inhibitors decrease drug metabolism, increase drug levels
- Boosted ARVs: All Protease Inhibitors & Elvitegravir (INSTI)
- Ritonavir (PI & Booster): PI side effects & CYP drug interactions
- Cobicistat (Booster Alone): CYP drug interactions but no PI side effects
