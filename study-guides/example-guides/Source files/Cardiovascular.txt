Objectives
1. Demonstrate proper utilization and placement of the stethoscope, cardiac inspection,
and palpation.
2. Determine when to use the bell or diaphragm when conducting a cardiac physical exam.
3. Explain the mechanism for different types of heart sounds: S1, S2, S3, S4, split
S2(normal, wide, fixed wide, and paradoxical), mitral valve prolapse, cardiac friction rub.
4. For the following conditions, describe the exam findings including timing, auscultation
location, shape, characteristics, and if there are maneuvers to manipulate the sound:
Aortic stenosis, Mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect, and mitral valve prolapse.
5. For the following conditions, describe timing and location on physical exam: TS, PS, PR,
AR, TR.
6. Define JVD and JVP and demonstrate measurement of JVP.
7. Demonstrate a correct and detailed cardiovascular physical exam and the pertinent
specialized tests.

Inspection for Cardiovascular Assessment
• For the practical we will only be inspecting the heart and chest during
the cardiac exam.
• In the real world, the cardiac assessment includes:
• Consideration of Vitals
• Overall assessment of the patient
• Looking for epidemiology, comorbidity, and evidence of
cardiovascular disease.

• Examine from the right side of the patient
• Palpate lightly so you can detect vibration or movements
34
--- PAGE 35 ---
Cardiac Inspection and Palpation: Inspection
With Patient at $30^{\circ}$, Observe for:
• Abnormal movements. $Heaves/lifts$
• Point of maximal impulse (PMI)
• Scars
• Bruising/swelling

--- PAGE 36 ---
Cardiac Inspection
and Palpation:
palpation
With Patient at $30^{\circ}$, Palpate the Base, Left sternal
border, and apex to identify:
• Point of Maximal Impulse (PMI)
• Abnormalities
• Thrills: purr-like vibrations from abnormal blood
flow
• Heaves/ lifts: Lifting movement felt under
anterior chest.
Avoid saying,
"feeling for
thrills" (we
palpate)
36

Cardiac Inspection and Palpation: Point of Maximal Impulse (PMI)
What else is at 5th ICS
midclavicular line?
Apical impulse/ PMI are
usually at 5th ICS
midclavicular line
(normally size of quarter)
If not palpable, check with
patient in left lateral
decubitus position.
Cardiomegaly or
COPD usually
have laterally
displaced PMI and
spans larger area

Specialized exams: Hepatojugular reflux
• It is normal for jugular venous pressure to increase with this
maneuver.
• Abnormal increase >3cm indicates that the right ventricle cannot
manage increased venous return.
                  1. Patient at $30^{\circ}$. Stand on patient's right.
                  2. Apply steady abdominal pressure in RUQ
for 10 seconds and observe height of
internal jugular venous pulsation from
sternal angle.
Increase above baseline $>3cm=$

S2 Splitting
73
--- PAGE 74 ---
S2 Splitting: Physiologic Split S2
                        1. It's normal for pulmonic valve to close slightly after the aortic
valve (S2 split)
• Why? Left side empties earlier (more muscular wall)
                        2. It's normal for S2 split to be wider during inspiration than
expiration
• Why? Inspiration causes increase right ventricle venous return
due to negative intrathoracic pressure, which cause longer
ejection time.
• This causes the pulmonic valve to be even later.
                        3. It's easiest to hear physiologic split with slower heart rates.

visceral and parietal pericardium then rubbing together.
• Simulate by placing your stethoscope on the palm of your hand and
scratch the dorsum
• Can be three sounds: atrial systole, ventricular systole, and rapid
ventricular filling during diastole
• Best heard in the left parasternal third intercostal space with patient
leaning forward, holding breath after forced exhalation

Loud flow

--- PAGE 87 ---
Murmur concepts
• Normal heart
• Blood flows smoothly (quietly) through completely open valves
• When valve closes, it has a tight seal; no leaks
• Murmur
• Blood flows through narrow valves (stenosis)
• Blood flows backward through leaking valves (regurgitation)
• Blood flows through defects
• Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
• Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)

Murmur Reflection
Stenosis: Do we hear it in systole or diastole?
Valve stenosis- turbulence from blood moving forward over a
narrow/calcified valve open valve.
• For AV valves, we will hear the stenosis murmur during diastole
• For a semilunar valve, we will hear the stenosis murmur in systole

Murmur Reflection
Regurgitation: Do we hear it in systole or diastole?
Valve regurgitation- turbulence from blood moving backward over an
incompletely closed valve.

• For a Semilunar Valve, we will hear the regurgitation murmur in diastole

• Evaluates for radial or ulnar artery insufficiency.
• Important before arterial line is placed.
• Ask patient to make a tight fist.
• Compress both ulnar and radial arteries with thumbs.
• Patient opens hand, palm is pale
• Release ulnar artery only.
Test is normal (negative) If palm flushes in 3-5 seconds.
Positive test >5 sec = ulnar insufficiency
• Repeat all steps (except release radial artery) to evaluate the radial artery.

best place to listen
to the tricuspid
valve?

Knowledge check
• A patient has internal jugular venous
pulsations measured 4cm above the
sternal angle.
What is the Jugular
Venous Pressure , and do they have
JVD?
138
Yes.
JVD is internal jugular venous pulsations
measured >3cm above sternal angle. Pulse
pressure = 4cm + 5cm= 9cm.
JVP >8cm is Jugular Venous Distension and
can also be described as Elevated (abnormal)
Jugular Venous Pressure.

Check for understanding
•Where would you feel the pulse in the S1 S2
Cycle?
Right After S1

Utilizing a tunable stethoscope, you apply light pressure with the
chestpiece.
What pitch (high or low) is best heard?
• Low pitched
Which heart sounds are best heard with light pressure using the
chestpiece?
• S3, S4, AV stenosis, Stills murmur, venous hum
