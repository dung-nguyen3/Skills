- Receptor names (e.g., "alpha-1", "beta-2", "D2")
- Mechanism descriptions
- Side effect names
- Contraindication statements
- Anatomical terms
- Disease names
- Laboratory values
- Treatment protocols

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Paraphrase medical terms
- ❌ Use synonyms for drug names
- ❌ Simplify technical terminology
- ❌ Reword mechanism descriptions
- ❌ Change disease classifications

**DO:**
- ✅ Copy exact terminology from source
- ✅ Preserve capitalization from source
- ✅ Use source's abbreviations
- ✅ Keep source's phrasing for complex concepts
</exact-wording-requirement>

## Examples: Correct vs. Incorrect

### Example 1: Drug Mechanism

**Source states:** "Metoprolol selectively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart"

**CORRECT Card:**
```
Q: What receptors does metoprolol block?
A: Beta-1 adrenergic receptors
```

**INCORRECT Cards:**
```
Q: What does metoprolol target?
A: Heart receptors  ← WRONG: Too vague, not exact wording

Q: What receptors does metoprolol block?
A: β1 receptors in cardiac tissue  ← WRONG: Changed terminology ("β1" vs "beta-1", "cardiac tissue" vs "heart")
```

---

### Example 2: Side Effects

**Source states:** "Common adverse effects include bradycardia, hypotension, and fatigue"

**CORRECT Cards:**
```
Q: What are the common adverse effects of [drug]?
A: Bradycardia, hypotension, and fatigue
```

**INCORRECT Cards:**
```
Q: What are the side effects?
A: Low heart rate, low blood pressure, tiredness  ← WRONG: Paraphrased medical terms

Q: What are the adverse effects?
A: Bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, and dizziness  ← WRONG: Added "dizziness" not in source
```

---

### Example 3: Drug Classifications

**Source states:** "Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor"

**CORRECT Card:**
```
Q: What drug class is lisinopril?
A: ACE inhibitor
```

**INCORRECT Cards:**
```
Q: What type of drug is lisinopril?
A: Blood pressure medication  ← WRONG: Too vague, not the classification from source

Q: What drug class is lisinopril?
A: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor  ← WRONG: Source used abbreviation "ACE inhibitor"
```

---

## Learning Objective Filtering

### Mandatory LO Extraction

**BEFORE creating ANY flashcards:**

1. **Extract all Learning Objectives from source**
2. **List them verbatim** (no paraphrasing)
3. **Map content to LOs** - identify which facts answer which LOs
4. **Create cards ONLY for LO-mapped content**

### LO Content Mapping Process

**For EACH learning objective, identify:**
- **Foundation facts:** Prerequisite knowledge needed to understand the answer
- **Direct facts:** Facts that directly answer the LO
- **Supporting context:** Context that leads to or supports the answer
- **Exclude:** Content unrelated to any LO

**Example LO Mapping:**
```
LO 1: "Describe the mechanism of action of beta-blockers"

Foundation facts to include:
- Beta-adrenergic receptors exist in heart (beta-1) and lungs (beta-2)
- Sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate and contractility
- Beta receptors mediate sympathetic effects

Direct facts to include:
- Beta-blockers block beta-adrenergic receptors
- Blocking beta-1 reduces heart rate and contractility
- Selective beta-blockers target beta-1 specifically

Supporting context:
- Clinical use: hypertension, angina, arrhythmias
- Why selectivity matters: avoid bronchoconstriction

EXCLUDE (not related to mechanism):
- Pharmacokinetics (absorption, metabolism)
- Drug-drug interactions
- Dosing information
```

### LO-Relevance Test

**Include content if:**
- ✅ Directly answers the learning objective
- ✅ Provides foundation needed to understand the answer
- ✅ Supports or contextualizes the answer
- ✅ Would help student answer exam question based on the LO

**Exclude content if:**
- ❌ No relationship to any learning objective
- ❌ Tangential or off-topic information
- ❌ Interesting but not required by LOs

**When uncertain:** Include if it helps understanding, but note the LO it relates to

## Flashcard Creation Guidelines

### Question Quality Standards

**1. Clarity and Specificity**
- Ask ONE specific concept per question
- Make questions self-contained (no "it", "this", "they")
- Use proper nouns (drug names, disease names) in questions
- Avoid ambiguous pronouns

**GOOD Questions:**
```
"What is the mechanism of action of metoprolol?"
"Which drug class blocks ACE?"
"What are the adverse effects of lisinopril?"
"Where does penicillin act?"
```

**BAD Questions:**
```
"What does it do?"  ← "it" is ambiguous
"How does this work?"  ← "this" unclear
"What are the side effects?"  ← Which drug?
"Mechanism?"  ← Of what?
```

**2. Question Type Variety**
- **What:** "What is the mechanism of [drug]?"
- **Which:** "Which drug class treats [condition]?"
- **Where:** "Where does [drug] act?"
- **How:** "How does [drug] cause [effect]?"
- **Define:** "Define [term]"
- **Describe:** "Describe [concept]"
- **List:** "What are the adverse effects of [drug]?"

**3. Avoid Yes/No Questions**
- ❌ "Is metoprolol a beta-blocker?" (yes/no = poor retention)
- ✅ "What drug class is metoprolol?" (requires recall)

**4. Use Exact Terminology in Questions**
- Use exact drug names from source
- Use exact disease names from source
- Use exact receptor names from source

---

### Answer Quality Standards

**1. Conciseness**
- **Typical length:** 3-15 words
- **One concept per answer**
- **Core fact only** - no lengthy explanations

**GOOD Answers:**
```
"Beta-1 adrenergic receptors"  (4 words)
"ACE inhibitor"  (2 words)
"Bradycardia, hypotension, and fatigue"  (4 words)
"Inhibits transpeptidase enzyme"  (3 words)
```

**BAD Answers:**
```
"Metoprolol blocks beta-1 receptors in the heart which reduces heart rate and blood pressure making it useful for treating hypertension and angina"  ← TOO LONG (multiple concepts)

"The beta receptors"  ← TOO VAGUE (which type?)
```

**2. Exact Terminology**
- **CRITICAL:** Use EXACT wording from source for medical terms
- Preserve capitalization, abbreviations, hyphenation
- Do NOT paraphrase or use synonyms

**Example - CORRECT:**
```
Source: "Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme"
Card Answer: "Angiotensin-converting enzyme" or "ACE" (if source uses that abbreviation)
```

**Example - INCORRECT:**
```
Source: "Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme"
Card Answer: "The enzyme that converts angiotensin"  ← WRONG: Paraphrased
```

**3. Single Concept**
- One fact per answer
- Don't combine multiple mechanisms, uses, or effects
- Create separate cards for separate concepts

**GOOD (separate cards):**
```
Q: "What is the mechanism of metoprolol?"
A: "Blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors"

Q: "What are the clinical uses of metoprolol?"
A: "Hypertension, angina, arrhythmias"
```

**BAD (combined concepts):**
```
Q: "What is metoprolol?"
A: "Beta-blocker that blocks beta-1 receptors and is used for hypertension, angina, and arrhythmias"  ← WRONG: Multiple concepts
```

**4. No External Information**
- **ONLY use information from source file**
- Do NOT add external medical facts
- Do NOT supplement from your medical knowledge
- If source doesn't mention it, don't include it

---

## CSV Format Specifications

### Basic Structure

```csv
Question,Answer
"What is the mechanism of metoprolol?","Blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors"
"Which drug class is lisinopril?","ACE inhibitor"
"What are the adverse effects of metoprolol?","Bradycardia, hypotension, and fatigue"
```

### Escaping Rules

**1. Commas in text**
- Wrap entire field in quotes: `"Bradycardia, hypotension, and fatigue"`

**2. Quotes in text**
- Double the quotes: `"He said ""test"" today"` → displays as: He said "test" today

**3. Line breaks in text**
- Use `\n` for line breaks within a field
- Keep entire field in quotes

**4. Special characters**
- Greek letters: Use full names (alpha, beta) or Unicode (α, β)
- Arrows: Use Unicode (→, ←) or text (->)
- Superscripts: Use ^ notation (10^6) or Unicode

## Python Implementation (genanki)

### Basic Structure

```python
import genanki
import random

# Create model (card template)
model_id = random.randrange(1 << 30, 1 << 31)
model = genanki.Model(
    model_id,
    'Basic Medical Card',
    fields=[
        {'name': 'Question'},
        {'name': 'Answer'},
    ],
    templates=[
        {
            'name': 'Card 1',
            'qfmt': '<div class="question">{{Question}}</div>',
            'afmt': '{{FrontSide}}<hr><div class="answer">{{Answer}}</div>',
        },
    ],
    css='''
        .card {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            font-size: 20px;
            text-align: center;
            padding: 20px;
        }
        .question {
            color: #2c3e50;
            margin-bottom: 20px;
        }
        .answer {
            color: #27ae60;
            margin-top: 20px;
        }
    '''
)

# Create deck
deck_id = random.randrange(1 << 30, 1 << 31)
deck = genanki.Deck(deck_id, 'Pharmacology - Beta Blockers')

# Add notes from CSV
import csv
with open('flashcards.csv', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    for row in reader:
        note = genanki.Note(
            model=model,
            fields=[row['Question'], row['Answer']]
        )
        deck.add_note(note)

# Save to .apkg file
genanki.Package(deck).write_to_file('Beta_Blockers.apkg')
print(f"✅ Created deck with {len(deck.notes)} cards")
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Mistakes

❌ **Paraphrasing medical terms**
```
Source: "Beta-1 adrenergic receptors"
Wrong: "Heart beta receptors"
Correct: "Beta-1 adrenergic receptors"
```

❌ **Adding external information**
```
Source mentions: "Bradycardia and hypotension"
Wrong: "Bradycardia, hypotension, and fatigue" (added fatigue not in source)
Correct: "Bradycardia and hypotension"
```

❌ **Creating cards for non-LO content**
```
LO: "Describe mechanism of beta-blockers"
Wrong: Creating cards about pharmacokinetics (not in LO)
Correct: Creating cards about receptor blocking mechanism
```

### Question Mistakes

❌ **Ambiguous questions**
```
Wrong: "What does it do?"  (what is "it"?)
Correct: "What is the mechanism of metoprolol?"
```

❌ **Multiple concepts in one question**
```
Wrong: "What is the mechanism and use of metoprolol?"
Correct: Two separate cards - one for mechanism, one for uses
```

### Answer Mistakes

❌ **Answers too long**
```
Wrong: "Metoprolol blocks beta-1 receptors which reduces heart rate and contractility leading to decreased blood pressure"
Correct: "Blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors"  (save other concepts for separate cards)
```

❌ **Multiple concepts in one answer**
```
Wrong: "ACE inhibitor used for hypertension and heart failure"
Correct: "ACE inhibitor"  (create separate card for uses)
```

### Technical Mistakes

❌ **CSV formatting errors**
```
Wrong: What are the uses?,Hypertension, angina  (comma not escaped)
Correct: "What are the uses?","Hypertension, angina"
```

❌ **Not escaping quotes**
```
Wrong: "The "preferred" drug"  (quotes not doubled)
Correct: "The ""preferred"" drug"
```
