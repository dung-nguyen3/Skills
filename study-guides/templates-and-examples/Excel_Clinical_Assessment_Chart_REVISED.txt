# EXCEL CLINICAL ASSESSMENT CHART TEMPLATE
# For clinical conditions requiring H&P-focused study (diseases, syndromes)

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Source-Only Policy**: Only use information from the source file. Do not add external medical knowledge.
2. **Mnemonic Research**: All mnemonics MUST be researched via WebSearch - never invent them.
3. **4-Tab Structure**: Key Comparisons, Master Chart, H&P Guide, Summary (in that order)
   - **Note**: This clinical chart's 4-tab structure IS APPROPRIATE and DIFFERENT from drug charts (which use 3 tabs). Tab 4 (Summary) is ESSENTIAL for clinical practice and includes RED FLAGS, mnemonics, and critical warnings that are vital for patient safety.
4. **Onset-Based Categorization**: Group conditions by onset pattern, not just category
5. **H&P Guide**: Comprehensive guide including OLDCAARTS history, PMH/FH/SH, ROS, Physical Exam with verbalizations, Patient Education, and Red Flags

---

## COLOR RULES (CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY)

**See:** `Excel_Color_Reference.txt` for complete color palette with HEADER and MAIN shades.

### Master Chart: Onset-Based Color Coding

| Onset Category | Color | Hex Code | Use For |
|----------------|-------|----------|---------|
| Acute | Blush Pink | #FCE4EC | Emergencies, immediate onset |
| Acute/Subacute | Soft Tangerine | #FFE8D6 | Days to weeks onset |
| Subacute | Champagne | #F7E7CE | Weeks onset |
| Chronic | Seafoam | #C8E6C9 | Months to years, degenerative |
| Chronic Inflammatory | Sky Blue | #BDD7EE | Chronic with inflammatory component |

### Key Comparisons Tab
- Each comparison TABLE gets ONE color SET (both HEADER and MAIN shades)
- Table title row and column headers = HEADER shade (25% darker)
- Data rows = MAIN shade (lighter)
- Change color SET when starting a NEW table

### Master Chart Tab
- Header row: Dark blue #4472C4 with white text, size 12
- Data rows: MAIN pastel colors based on ONSET category
- All conditions with same onset = same color

### Summary Tab
- Sheet title: Dark blue (#4472C4) with white text
- Mnemonic boxes: Light blue (#E6F3FF)
- Clinical pearl boxes: Light green (#E8F5E9)
- Red flags: Light red/pink background

---

## OBJECTIVE

Create comprehensive clinical assessment Excel files with:
1. **Key Comparison Sheet** - Side-by-side clinical differentials
2. **Master Chart Sheet** - All conditions with H&P-focused columns
3. **H&P Guide Sheet** - Comprehensive clinical encounter guide (OLDCAARTS, PMH/FH/SH, ROS, Physical Exam, Patient Education, Red Flags)
4. **Summary Sheet** - Mnemonics, "If X Think Y", Red Flags, High-Yield Pearls

---

## TAB 1: KEY COMPARISONS

### Purpose
Compare clinically similar conditions side-by-side for differential diagnosis

### Common Clinical Comparison Types
- Inflammatory vs Mechanical patterns
- Acute vs Chronic presentations
- LMN vs UMN signs
- Morning stiffness duration comparisons
- Physical exam test interpretations
- Dermatome/myotome quick reference

### Structure
- **COLUMNS** = Conditions being compared
- **ROWS** = Clinical comparison categories

### Layout Rules
```
Row 1: [COMPARISON TITLE - merged across all columns]
Row 2: [Column headers - conditions being compared]
Row 3+: [Comparison category rows]
[blank row]
[MNEMONIC row - if applicable]
[2-3 blank rows before next comparison table]
```

### Critical Rules
1. **One comparison per table** - Don't mix different comparisons
2. **Multiple tables** - Create separate tables for each comparison type
3. **Mnemonics directly below** - Place relevant mnemonic after each table
4. **Clinical focus** - Emphasize findings that differentiate conditions
5. **Column width**: Column A = 25, others = 35-40

---

## TAB 2: MASTER CHART (Clinical Assessment Focus)

### Purpose
Comprehensive clinical reference for all conditions with H&P-oriented information

### REQUIRED COLUMNS (7 columns)

| Column | Width | Content Focus |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| A: Condition | 28 | Condition name (bold) |
| B: Category/Onset | 18 | Onset pattern (Acute, Chronic, etc.) |
| C: Clinical Presentation | 45 | Symptoms, history, chief complaint patterns |
| D: Physical Exam Findings | 45 | Specific PE maneuvers, signs, what to look for |
| E: Diagnosis/Imaging | 38 | Labs, imaging, diagnostic criteria |
| F: Treatment | 42 | First-line, alternatives, referral criteria |
| G: Patient Education | 45 | Prognosis, lifestyle, red flags to watch |

### Layout Rules
```
Row 1: [Column Headers - frozen]
Row 2+: [One condition per row, grouped by onset]
```

### Onset Grouping Order
1. Acute (emergencies first)
2. Acute/Subacute
3. Subacute
4. Chronic
5. Chronic Inflammatory

### Text Formatting Within Cells
- Use bullet points or line breaks for lists
- ⭐ = Hallmark/pathognomonic finding
- ⚠️ = Warning/red flag
- 🟢 = First-line treatment
- ❗ = Critical point
- ✅ = Positive finding/expected result

---

## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS - Python Reference

**→ See Excel_Clinical_Assessment_Example.py for exact implementation of all formatting requirements**

### Colors
- ONSET_COLORS system (Acute, Subacute, Chronic categorization)
- Clinical Assessment uses its own color scheme (NOT the standard COLOR_SETS)
- All data cells MUST have pastel backgrounds

**→ See Excel_Clinical_Assessment_Example.py for exact ONSET_COLORS definitions**

### Borders
- White thin borders on ALL cells
- Apply to ALL cells BEFORE merging (see merged cell section below)

**→ See Excel_Clinical_Assessment_Example.py for border definitions**

### Row Heights & Column Widths
- Vary by content type and tab

**→ See Excel_Clinical_Assessment_Example.py for exact dimensions per element**

### CRITICAL: Merged Cell Border Behavior

When merging cells in openpyxl, only the top-left cell retains styling (borders, colors, etc.). Other cells become MergedCell objects and lose formatting.

**CORRECT PATTERN (always use):**
1. Apply styling (borders, colors, fonts) to ALL cells in range FIRST
2. THEN merge the cells

**Example:**
```python
# Step 1: Style ALL cells in the range
for col_idx in range(start_col, end_col + 1):
    cell = ws.cell(current_row, col_idx)
    apply_cell_style(cell, text=value if col_idx==start_col else '', bg_color=color)

# Step 2: THEN merge
ws.merge_cells(start_row=current_row, start_column=start_col,
               end_row=current_row, end_column=end_col)
```

**→ See Excel_Clinical_Assessment_Example.py lines 111-119, 156-162, 168-176, 447-455, 461-468 for complete implementation**

CERVICAL SPINE:
- Flexion: "Bend head forward with chin to chest"
- Extension: "Bend head backward"
- Lateral bending: "Bend head to one side, trying to touch ear to shoulder"
- Rotation: "Rotate head to look over shoulder while keeping rest of spine straight"

THORACOLUMBAR SPINE (stabilize pelvis):
- Flexion: "Bend forward at the hips"
- Extension: "Bend backward at the hips"
- Lateral bending: "Bend to the side like picking up a suitcase"
- Rotation: "Rotate to look behind you using your entire back"
```

##### 4d. LOWER EXTREMITY - INSPECTION
```

- Casual walk: Observe gait and posture
- Walk on heels: Assesses L4-L5 (dorsiflexion)
- Walk on toes: Assesses S1 (plantar flexion)
- Heel-to-toe (tandem): Balance assessment

STRENGTH TESTING:
VERBALIZATION: "I am assessing strength bilaterally."
- Hip flexion (L1-L2): "Lift your knee up as I try to press it down"
- Hip abduction: "Push your legs outward against my resistance"
- Hip adduction: "Push your legs inward against my resistance"
- Knee flexion (L5-S1): "Pull your leg in against my resistance"
- Knee extension (L3-L4): "Kick your leg out against my resistance"
- Ankle dorsiflexion (L4-L5): "Pull your foot up towards the ceiling against my hand"
- Ankle plantar flexion (S1-S2): "Push down against my hand like your foot is on the accelerator"

REFLEXES (compare bilaterally, assess for hyper/hyporeflexia):
- Patellar (L3-L4): Strike patellar tendon, observe knee extension
- Achilles (S1-S2): Strike Achilles tendon, observe plantar flexion
- Babinski (UMN): Stroke heel to 5th toe then across ball of foot (makes "7")
  - Normal: flexion of toes
  - Abnormal (positive): fanning of toes
```

##### 4g. SPECIALIZED TESTS
```
STRAIGHT LEG RAISE (SLR):
With pt supine, lift leg off table until pain elicited. Note angle. May dorsiflex foot.
SEATED OPTION: Extend knee, evaluate for backward movement, pain, paresthesia into LE.
POSITIVE: Radiating pain down leg → lumbosacral/sciatic radiculopathy

CROSSED SLR:
Perform SLR on asymptomatic leg.
POSITIVE: Pain in symptomatic leg when raising contralateral leg = highly specific for disc herniation

SPURLING MANEUVER:
With pt seated/standing, position pt to rotate and extend head. Apply mild compression at top of head.
POSITIVE: Pain/paresthesia into upper extremity → cervical radiculopathy

FABER/PATRICK TEST:
Pt supine, position leg in figure-four (flexion, abduction, external rotation of hip).
Place one hand at contralateral ASIS and other hand on ipsilateral knee.
POSITIVE: Reproduced pain → hip or SI joint pathology
```

##### 4h. SENSORY DERMATOMES
```
VERBALIZATION: "Close your eyes. Tell me when you feel me touch you and if it feels sharp or dull."

L4: Knee, medial shin (anterior leg)
L5: Anterolateral shin, dorsal foot, great toe
S1: Posterior leg, lateral/plantar foot
Saddle area (S2-S4): EMERGENCY - perineal sensory changes suggest Cauda Equina Syndrome

- NEVER invent or create your own mnemonics
- Only use proven mnemonics from medical education resources (USMLE, medical school materials)
- If no mnemonic is found via WebSearch, do not include one

### Search Strategy
```
Search queries to use:
- "medical mnemonics [specific topic]"
- "[condition] mnemonic USMLE"
- "how to remember [finding] medical school"
- "[differential] memory trick"
```

### Rules
- ONLY use mnemonics found through WebSearch research
- NEVER invent new mnemonics under any circumstances
- Include full breakdown of each letter/word
- Place mnemonics directly below relevant comparison tables
- Cite source when possible
