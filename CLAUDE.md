# Skills Repository - Global Settings

This repository contains Claude Code infrastructure examples and study guide materials.

## Personal Context

- Explain technical concepts clearly - I'm learning

## General Rules

### File Management
- Never create files in home directory (use project directories)
- Always use absolute paths, not relative paths
- Ask before creating new files unless explicitly required

### Communication Style
